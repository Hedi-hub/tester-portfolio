- Lack of necessary resources or test environment failures.

### Exit Criteria
- All planned tests have been executed.
- **Run Rate:** At least **95%** of all test cases have been executed.
- **Pass Rate:** At least **90%** of executed test cases have passed.
- All critical and high-priority defects have been resolved and closed.
- No **severity 1** or **severity 2** defects are open.
- Performance metrics meet the defined standards.
- Security vulnerabilities have been identified and addressed.
- User acceptance testing has been completed, and sign-off has been obtained.
